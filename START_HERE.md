**Backend won't start?**
- Ensure MongoDB is running: `mongod`
- Check .env file exists with all keys
- Verify port 5000 is available

**Frontend won't load?**
- Check http://localhost:5173 (not 3000!)
- Open browser console (F12) for errors
- Ensure `npm run dev` is running

**API errors?**
- Verify Gemini key is valid
- Check MongoDB connection string
- Look at terminal output for clues
